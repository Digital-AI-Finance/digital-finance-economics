# Economics of Digital Finance

**BSc Course - 8 Lessons x 45 Minutes**

## Course Overview

This course examines digital finance through four economic lenses:

1. **Monetary Economics**: CBDCs, money theory, payment systems, financial stability
2. **Platform/Network Economics**: Network effects, two-sided markets, token economics
3. **Market Microstructure**: Price discovery, liquidity, trading mechanisms
4. **Regulatory Economics**: Financial regulation, competition policy, consumer protection

## Target Audience

Economics and finance students with strong theoretical background. Focus is on economic analysis rather than technical implementation.
