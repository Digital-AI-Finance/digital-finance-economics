    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "In the network contagion simulation, a healthy node fails when:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Its capital buffer is larger than average",
        "B": "Cumulative losses from failed neighbors exceed its capital buffer",
        "C": "It has the fewest network connections",
        "D": "A regulator forces it to close"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The Acemoglu et al. (2015) contagion model shows that nodes fail when the cumulative losses transmitted by failed neighbors (each transmitting original_buffer / degree) exceed the receiving node's capital buffer. This is the core cascade mechanism."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In the contagion model, a failed node with 5 connections and a capital buffer of 0.10 transmits what loss to each neighbor?",
      "options": {
        "A": "0.10 (the full buffer)",
        "B": "0.50 (buffer times degree)",
        "C": "0.02 (buffer divided by degree)",
        "D": "0.05 (half the buffer)"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Loss per neighbor = original_buffer / degree = 0.10 / 5 = 0.02. Highly connected nodes spread losses more thinly across neighbors, while poorly connected nodes concentrate losses on fewer counterparts."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A node in the contagion network becomes 'stressed' (orange) rather than 'failed' (red) when:",
      "options": {
        "A": "It has zero connections to failed nodes",
        "B": "Its cumulative losses exceed 50% of its buffer but remain below 100%",
        "C": "It voluntarily reduces lending",
        "D": "Government provides emergency liquidity"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The simulation uses two thresholds: 'stressed' when cumulative losses exceed 50% of the capital buffer, and 'failed' when losses exceed 100%. This creates two distinct vulnerability states visible in the network visualization."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "The cascade dynamics bar chart shows that most new failures occur in which round?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Round 0 (the initial shock)",
        "B": "Round 1 (the first cascade wave)",
        "C": "Round 5 (delayed effects)",
        "D": "Failures are spread equally across all rounds"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Contagion cascades typically show the largest wave of new failures in Round 1 (immediate neighbors of the shock node), with each subsequent round producing fewer failures as remaining nodes are further from the epicenter or have larger buffers."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "The TradFi-DeFi convergence chart shows two S-curves approaching each other. What does the 'convergence corridor' represent?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The period when both TradFi and DeFi adoption decline",
        "B": "The zone where TradFi digitization and DeFi adoption levels become similar",
        "C": "A government-mandated merger of traditional and decentralized finance",
        "D": "The time when all financial institutions switch to DeFi"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The convergence corridor marks where the gap between TradFi digitization and DeFi adoption narrows below a threshold. The coupled S-curve model includes spillover effects: TradFi learns from DeFi innovations, and DeFi benefits from TradFi infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "According to the convergence model, why does DeFi adoption grow more slowly than its base growth rate would suggest?",
      "options": {
        "A": "DeFi technology is inherently inferior",
        "B": "Regulatory friction (parameter 0.85) reduces DeFi's effective growth",
        "C": "TradFi actively blocks DeFi development",
        "D": "Users prefer cash over digital systems"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The model includes a regulatory friction parameter (0.85) that multiplies DeFi's growth rate, reducing it below its theoretical maximum. Similarly, TradFi faces a technology friction parameter (0.92). These frictions model real-world adoption barriers."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Rogers' (1962) diffusion of innovation theory, referenced in the convergence slide, suggests DeFi is currently in which adoption phase?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Innovators (first 2.5%)",
        "B": "Early adopters (next 13.5%)",
        "C": "Early majority (next 34%)",
        "D": "Late majority (next 34%)"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "The slide states DeFi is entering the 'early majority' phase, with incumbent banks now adopting blockchain technology. The technology lifecycle shows: innovators (early crypto natives), early adopters (fintech firms), early majority (incumbent banks, happening now)."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What does the spillover parameter alpha_D = 0.004 in the convergence model represent?",
      "options": {
        "A": "DeFi's maximum possible market share",
        "B": "The rate at which DeFi benefits from TradFi's existing infrastructure",
        "C": "The probability of DeFi protocol failure",
        "D": "The regulatory approval rate for DeFi projects"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The spillover parameter alpha_D captures how DeFi's growth rate increases as TradFi digitization advances. As TradFi builds digital infrastructure (APIs, digital identities, electronic settlement), DeFi protocols can leverage this infrastructure, accelerating their own adoption."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "In the blockchain trilemma chart, Bitcoin is positioned near the Decentralization-Security edge. What does this mean?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bitcoin is the fastest blockchain",
        "B": "Bitcoin optimizes for decentralization and security but sacrifices scalability (only ~7 transactions per second)",
        "C": "Bitcoin has no security features",
        "D": "Bitcoin is controlled by a single entity"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Bitcoin's barycentric coordinates (D=0.45, S=0.45, Sc=0.10) show it strongly favors decentralization and security, with very low scalability. The chart's dashed arrow labeled 'Scaling tradeoff' shows that improving Bitcoin's scalability requires sacrificing some D or S."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "The trilemma chart places Visa at coordinates (D=0.05, S=0.45, Sc=0.50). What trade-off has Visa made?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High decentralization at the cost of speed",
        "B": "High security and scalability at the cost of decentralization",
        "C": "Equal balance across all three dimensions",
        "D": "Maximum scalability with no security"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Visa's position near the Security-Scalability edge means it processes thousands of transactions per second (high Sc) with robust fraud protection (high S), but as a centralized payment network, it has almost no decentralization (D=0.05)."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "The trilemma constraint D + S + Sc <= K means that:",
      "options": {
        "A": "All systems must be equally decentralized, secure, and scalable",
        "B": "Improving one dimension requires sacrificing at least one other",
        "C": "K is always exactly 1.0 for all systems",
        "D": "Only two of the three dimensions can exist at all"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The constraint means the total 'budget' across all three properties is limited. A system that maximizes two dimensions (like Bitcoin with D+S) must accept a low score on the third (Sc). This is analogous to Mundell's impossible trinity in monetary policy."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Which system on the trilemma chart represents a balanced compromise across all three dimensions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bitcoin (D=0.45, S=0.45, Sc=0.10)",
        "B": "Visa (D=0.05, S=0.45, Sc=0.50)",
        "C": "Lightning Network (D=0.35, S=0.35, Sc=0.30)",
        "D": "BSC (D=0.15, S=0.35, Sc=0.50)"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Lightning Network (D=0.35, S=0.35, Sc=0.30) is the most balanced system on the chart, positioned near the center of the triangle. It achieves this by operating as a Layer 2 solution on top of Bitcoin, trading some of each property for moderate scores across all three."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "In the policy effectiveness heatmap, which instrument has the strongest negative effect on Innovation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CBDC (+0.2 on Innovation)",
        "B": "Stablecoin Regulation (-0.4 on Innovation)",
        "C": "KYC/AML (-0.7 on Innovation)",
        "D": "Crypto Tax (-0.5 on Innovation)"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "KYC/AML scores -0.7 on Innovation, the most negative effect in the matrix. Strict identity verification requirements create barriers to entry, increase compliance costs, and slow experimental development -- a key trade-off between security and innovation."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "According to the policy heatmap, which instrument is most effective at improving Financial Inclusion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CBDC (+0.8)",
        "B": "Stablecoin Regulation (+0.1)",
        "C": "DeFi Rules (0.0)",
        "D": "KYC/AML (-0.2)"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "CBDC scores +0.8 on Financial Inclusion, the highest positive score in that column. CBDCs can provide bank-like services to unbanked populations through central bank accounts, bypassing commercial bank requirements."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "The policy heatmap's welfare analysis panel shows that 'Firms' are most negatively affected by which policy instrument?",
      "options": {
        "A": "CBDC, because it competes with private services",
        "B": "KYC/AML, because firms weight Innovation at 0.5 and KYC/AML scores -0.7 on Innovation",
        "C": "Crypto Tax, because it reduces revenue",
        "D": "All instruments affect firms equally"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Firms weight Innovation highest (w=0.5). Since KYC/AML has the most negative Innovation score (-0.7), multiplying weight times impact (0.5 x -0.7 = -0.35) creates the largest negative welfare contribution for firms from any single policy-objective combination."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "The policy effectiveness matrix shows Stablecoin Regulation scoring +0.9 on Stability and +0.8 on Consumer Protection, but -0.4 on Innovation. This illustrates:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stablecoin regulation is ineffective",
        "B": "A fundamental trade-off where safety-focused regulation reduces room for experimentation",
        "C": "Innovation and stability are always compatible",
        "D": "Consumer protection always harms financial inclusion"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Stablecoin regulation exemplifies the innovation-stability trade-off. Reserve requirements, redemption rights, and licensing protect consumers and financial stability but restrict the design space for novel stablecoin mechanisms, reducing innovation scores."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "In the four lenses integration heatmap, which digital finance phenomenon scores highest on the Monetary lens?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bitcoin (score: 9)",
        "B": "Stablecoins (score: 8)",
        "C": "CBDCs (score: 10)",
        "D": "DeFi/AMMs (score: 3)"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "CBDCs score a perfect 10 on the Monetary lens, reflecting their direct connection to central bank operations, monetary policy transmission, and sovereign currency functions. This is the highest score of any phenomenon on any single lens."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "DeFi/AMMs score 10 on Microstructure but only 3 on Monetary in the four lenses heatmap. This suggests:",
      "options": {
        "A": "DeFi is irrelevant to economics",
        "B": "DeFi is primarily about trading mechanisms and price discovery, not money creation or central banking",
        "C": "The Monetary lens is unimportant",
        "D": "All phenomena should score equally across lenses"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "DeFi/AMMs are quintessentially microstructure phenomena -- automated market makers, liquidity pools, and on-chain price discovery. Their low Monetary score reflects that DeFi protocols are primarily about exchange mechanisms, not money supply or monetary policy."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Applying all four lenses to the Terra/Luna collapse (2022), which lens explains the initial trigger?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Monetary: the algorithmic peg was unbacked private money that lost confidence",
        "B": "Platform: insufficient network effects prevented adoption",
        "C": "Microstructure: AMM design was technically flawed",
        "D": "Regulatory: regulators forced Terra to shut down"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "The Monetary lens explains the trigger: Terra/UST was an algorithmic stablecoin (unbacked private money) that collapsed when confidence broke, creating a reflexive death spiral. The other lenses explain amplification (Platform: network effects reversed; Microstructure: liquidity dried up) and prevention failure (Regulatory: no oversight)."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "The course's central thesis is that 'no single economic lens suffices' for analyzing digital finance. Which case best demonstrates why all four lenses are needed simultaneously?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A simple Bitcoin purchase on a centralized exchange",
        "B": "A stablecoin run that triggers DeFi liquidations, spreads to exchanges, and prompts regulatory intervention",
        "C": "A central bank raising interest rates",
        "D": "A company issuing traditional stock on a stock exchange"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "A stablecoin run requires Monetary analysis (money demand shock), Platform analysis (network effects in redemptions), Microstructure analysis (liquidity spirals, price impact), and Regulatory analysis (reserve requirements, intervention). This cross-cutting event cannot be fully understood through any single lens."
