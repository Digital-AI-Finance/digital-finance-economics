      "question": "In the Bass diffusion model, what do the parameters p and q represent?",
      "options": {
        "A": "p = innovation coefficient (external influence), q = imitation coefficient (internal influence)",
        "B": "p = price elasticity, q = quality factor",
        "C": "p = profit margin, q = quantity demanded",
        "D": "p = platform size, q = quarterly growth rate"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "The Bass model describes adoption through external innovation (p) where users adopt independently, and internal imitation (q) where users adopt based on existing adopters. The diffusion equation is dN/dt = (p + q*N/M)*(M - N)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In the Bass diffusion model, which combination of parameters produces the FASTEST platform adoption?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Low p (innovation), low q (imitation)",
        "B": "High p, high q",
        "C": "High p, low q",
        "D": "Low p, high q"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Both high external influence (p) and strong network effects (q) accelerate the S-curve. High p drives early adoption from external marketing and media, while high q amplifies growth through word-of-mouth and network effects once a user base exists. Together they produce the steepest adoption curve."

      "question": "Uber connecting riders and drivers benefits from which type of network effect?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Direct network effects (more riders benefit other riders)",
        "B": "Indirect (cross-side) network effects (more riders attract more drivers, and vice versa)",
        "C": "Negative network effects (more users reduce value)",
        "D": "No network effects (Uber's value is independent of user count)"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Uber is a two-sided market where riders and drivers are distinct user groups. More riders attract more drivers (higher earning potential), and more drivers attract more riders (shorter wait times, lower prices). This cross-side feedback loop is the defining feature of indirect network effects."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What distinguishes indirect network effects from direct ones?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Indirect effects are weaker and can be ignored in platform design",
        "B": "Indirect effects occur between different user groups (e.g., buyers and sellers)",
        "C": "Indirect effects only apply to blockchain platforms",
        "D": "Indirect effects decrease as the platform grows"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Indirect (cross-side) network effects arise in two-sided markets where value for one group depends on participation of another group. Examples include marketplaces (buyers-sellers) or app stores (users-developers)."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "In the critical mass model, what is the unstable equilibrium?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The point where adoption cost equals adoption benefit",
        "B": "The threshold below which the platform collapses and above which it grows rapidly",
        "C": "The maximum sustainable adoption rate",
        "D": "The inflection point of the S-curve"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The unstable equilibrium (shown as dashed red line) is the critical mass threshold. Below it, the platform tends toward zero adoption; above it, positive feedback drives growth toward full adoption. It separates two stable equilibria."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "When adoption cost is very low relative to network benefits, what is the most likely market outcome?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Multiple equilibria exist with path dependence",
        "B": "Only the high-adoption stable equilibrium exists",
        "C": "The platform cannot sustain any users",
        "D": "Adoption becomes chaotic and unpredictable"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "At low adoption costs, the benefit threshold is easily met, leading to a single high stable equilibrium. As costs increase past the critical threshold (~0.25 in the model), multiple equilibria emerge with a coordination problem."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What defines a 'winner-take-all' market structure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Legal monopolies enforced by government regulation",
        "B": "Strong network effects and high switching costs leading to market concentration",
        "C": "First-mover advantage that cannot be overcome",
        "D": "Markets where only one company is profitable"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Winner-take-all dynamics emerge from strong network effects combined with high switching costs and low multi-homing benefits. Early leads get amplified through positive feedback, as shown in the Polya urn simulation where initial advantages compound."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "The Polya urn model demonstrates which key property of platform competition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Platforms eventually reach equal market share through competition",
        "B": "Path dependence: small early advantages can determine long-run outcomes",
        "C": "New entrants always overcome incumbents through innovation",
        "D": "Market share is determined solely by product quality"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The Polya urn shows increasing returns to adoption: probability of gaining users is proportional to current size (counts + 1). Different random seeds produce vastly different final market shares, demonstrating path dependence and lock-in effects."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "A token that lets you pay for cloud storage on a decentralized network is best classified as:",
      "options": {
        "A": "A governance token (grants voting rights)",
        "B": "A utility token (provides access to platform services)",
        "C": "A security token (represents ownership shares)",
        "D": "A stablecoin (maintains a fixed price)"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Utility tokens grant access to platform functionality or serve as medium of exchange within the ecosystem. Paying for cloud storage is a direct platform service, making this a utility token. Governance tokens grant voting rights, security tokens represent ownership, and stablecoins maintain price pegs."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What distinguishes governance tokens from utility tokens?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Governance tokens have unlimited supply, utility tokens are capped",
        "B": "Governance tokens grant voting rights on protocol decisions",
        "C": "Governance tokens cannot be traded on exchanges",
        "D": "Governance tokens are always more valuable"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Governance tokens enable decentralized decision-making by granting voting rights on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and treasury allocation. They may also carry utility features, but their core function is protocol governance."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "According to the equation of exchange (M*V = P*Q), what is token velocity (V)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The speed at which new tokens are minted",
        "B": "The number of times a token changes hands per period",
        "C": "The volatility of the token price",
        "D": "The rate at which tokens are burned"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Velocity measures transaction frequency: how often each token is used. High velocity means tokens circulate quickly, lowering market cap for given transaction volume (M = PQ/V). Low velocity from holding/staking increases value capture."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "In the velocity model, what is the effect of staking 50% of tokens?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It removes 50% of tokens from circulation, approximately doubling value per circulating token",
        "B": "It has no effect on market cap since staked tokens still exist",
        "C": "It increases velocity as stakers earn more rewards to spend",
        "D": "It reduces the transaction volume (PQ) by half"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "Staking removes 50% of tokens from circulation. From MV=PQ, if the circulating supply halves but transaction volume stays constant, the value per circulating token approximately doubles. This is shown by the gap between the base velocity and effective velocity curves."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What economic challenge does Bitcoin's fixed 21M supply cap create for long-term network security?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Transaction fees must eventually replace block rewards to fund security",
        "B": "Mining becomes more profitable as supply decreases",
        "C": "The supply cap can be increased through a consensus vote",
        "D": "Bitcoin will become inflationary once the cap is reached"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "As block rewards halve toward zero, miners must be compensated through transaction fees alone. This creates uncertainty about whether fees will provide sufficient security incentive. If fees are too low, miners may leave, reducing network security. This is one of the most debated long-term challenges in Bitcoin's economic design."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "How does Bitcoin's halving mechanism affect its supply schedule?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The total supply of Bitcoin is permanently reduced by half every 4 years",
        "B": "Block rewards are cut in half every 4 years, gradually approaching the 21M cap",
        "C": "Mining difficulty is halved every 4 years",
        "D": "Transaction fees are halved every 4 years"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Bitcoin's block reward halves every 210,000 blocks (~4 years): 50->25->12.5->6.25->3.125 BTC. This controls inflation rate while approaching the 21M cap. The chart shows halvings as vertical dotted lines with diminishing new supply."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What characterizes an inflationary token model?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fixed supply with no new issuance",
        "B": "Continuous or increasing token issuance that grows supply over time",
        "C": "Supply decreases each year through burns",
        "D": "Supply increases only when transaction volume increases"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Inflationary models continuously issue new tokens (e.g., +5% annually shown in red). This can fund development, reward validators, or incentivize participation, but may pressure price if demand doesn't match new supply."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is Ethereum's current supply trend after the Merge and EIP-1559?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Highly inflationary with 5%+ annual growth",
        "B": "Fixed cap like Bitcoin",
        "C": "Often net deflationary, as burns can exceed issuance during high-activity periods",
        "D": "Zero inflation with perfectly balanced issuance and burns"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Post-Merge ETH issuance (~0.5M/year) can be exceeded by EIP-1559 burns during high network activity. However, during low-activity periods, ETH may be slightly inflationary. The net trend depends on network usage: high activity = deflationary, low activity = mildly inflationary."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of token staking mechanisms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increase transaction speed",
        "B": "Reduce effective velocity and align long-term holder incentives",
        "C": "Eliminate the need for miners",
        "D": "Guarantee token price appreciation"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Staking locks tokens for rewards, creating a velocity sink that increases market cap (M=PQ/V with lower V). It also aligns incentives by rewarding long-term holders and gives them governance rights, reducing sell pressure."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "How do token burns affect the supply schedule?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They increase velocity by removing tokens from circulation",
        "B": "They reduce circulating supply, potentially increasing scarcity and per-token value",
        "C": "They have no effect since burned tokens can be recovered",
        "D": "They only affect transaction fees, not market cap"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Token burns permanently remove supply, shifting from inflationary to deflationary (-2%/year in green curve). With constant or growing demand, reduced supply increases scarcity. Combined with fee burns (like EIP-1559), this can create net deflation."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "What drives winner-take-all outcomes in DeFi protocol competition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Patents and intellectual property protection",
        "B": "Network effects from liquidity concentration and composability",
        "C": "Government licensing requirements",
        "D": "First-mover advantage from early liquidity concentration"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "DeFi exhibits path dependence through liquidity network effects (deeper liquidity attracts more traders), composability (protocols integrate with market leaders), and capital efficiency. The Polya urn model shows how early advantages compound through increasing returns. While first-mover advantage (option D) plays a role, it alone is insufficient without the ongoing network effects and composability that sustain dominance."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "According to the path dependence simulations, what determines final market structure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Only the quality of the platform matters",
        "B": "Early random events can have lasting effects on which platform dominates",
        "C": "The platform with the lowest prices always wins",
        "D": "Market shares always converge to equal distribution"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The inset showing different random seeds demonstrates that identical platforms can reach vastly different market shares based on early adoption patterns. This path dependence means small initial advantages (luck, timing, marketing) can determine long-run winners through positive feedback loops."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Under quadratic voting, a voter with 100 tokens can cast how many votes?",
      "options": {
        "A": "100 votes (same as linear voting)",
        "B": "10 votes (square root of tokens)",
        "C": "50 votes (half of tokens)",
        "D": "10,000 votes (tokens squared)"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Quadratic voting: cost of n votes = n^2 tokens. With 100 tokens, sqrt(100) = 10 votes. This reduces whale dominance because a voter with 10,000 tokens only gets 100 votes (not 10,000), compressing the power gap between large and small holders."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Why do some crypto exchanges offer zero trading fees to retail users?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They are charities that do not need revenue",
        "B": "They subsidize one side of a two-sided market to build network effects",
        "C": "Zero fees are required by regulation",
        "D": "The exchange has no operating costs"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Two-sided market theory (Rochet & Tirole 2003): platforms subsidize one side (retail traders) to attract volume, then extract value from the other side (market makers, premium services, data sales). The subsidy is an investment in network effects---more retail volume attracts more market makers, which improves liquidity, attracting even more retail users."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "What makes flash loan governance attacks possible?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Flash loans are illegal and cannot be prevented",
        "B": "Borrowed tokens can be used to vote, then returned immediately, requiring no real economic stake",
        "C": "Flash loans permanently transfer token ownership",
        "D": "All DAOs are vulnerable regardless of their design"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Flash loans allow borrowing and repaying within one transaction. An attacker borrows millions of governance tokens, votes on a malicious proposal, executes the result, and repays---all atomically. This gains governance power without economic commitment. Time-locked voting (requiring tokens to be held for a period before voting) prevents this by ensuring voters have real economic stake."
