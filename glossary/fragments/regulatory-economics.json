    "id": "adverse-selection",
    "detailed": "Adverse selection happens when one side of a deal knows more than the other, and this imbalance causes the market to fill up with low-quality participants. The concept comes from economist George Akerlof's \"lemons problem\": if used-car buyers cannot tell good cars from bad ones, they only offer low prices, so owners of good cars leave the market and only \"lemons\" (bad cars) remain. In financial markets, informed traders (those with private knowledge about an asset's true value) profit at the expense of uninformed traders, forcing market makers (firms that stand ready to buy and sell) to widen the bid-ask spread (the gap between buying and selling prices) to protect themselves from losses.",
    "example": "A crypto exchange lists a new token. Insiders know the project is failing, so they sell heavily. Regular buyers, unaware of this, keep purchasing at inflated prices. The informed insiders profit while uninformed buyers suffer losses -- a textbook adverse-selection problem."

    "id": "aml",
    "detailed": "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to the set of laws, regulations, and procedures that financial institutions must follow to detect and prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained money as legitimate income. Money laundering typically involves three stages: placement (putting dirty money into the financial system), layering (moving it around through complex transactions to obscure its origin), and integration (making it appear like normal business income). Banks and crypto exchanges must monitor transactions, report suspicious activity to authorities, and keep records. Failure to comply can result in heavy fines, criminal charges, or loss of operating licenses.",
    "example": "When you open a bank account or sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase, you must provide identification documents. If someone deposits EUR 50,000 in cash without explanation, the bank files a Suspicious Activity Report with regulators -- that is AML in action."

  {
    "id": "compliance-costs",
    "detailed": "Compliance costs are all the expenses -- both direct and indirect -- that a company must pay to follow government rules and regulations. Direct costs include hiring compliance officers, purchasing monitoring software, conducting audits, and filing mandatory reports. Indirect costs include the time employees spend on paperwork instead of productive work, delays in launching new products while awaiting regulatory approval, and opportunities lost because resources were diverted to meeting requirements. These costs are especially burdensome for small firms, which spend a larger share of their revenue on compliance than big companies do, creating an uneven playing field.",
    "example": "A small fintech startup wanting to offer payment services in the EU might spend EUR 500,000 per year on legal counsel, compliance staff, and reporting systems before earning a single euro in revenue. A large bank spreads similar fixed costs across millions of customers, paying just cents per account."
  },
  {
    "id": "consumer-protection",
    "detailed": "Consumer protection encompasses the rules, standards, and enforcement mechanisms designed to shield individuals from exploitation, fraud, misleading information, or unfair practices by businesses. In traditional finance, this includes requirements like clear disclosure of fees, cooling-off periods for contracts, deposit insurance (government guarantees on bank savings up to a limit), and complaint resolution procedures. In digital finance, consumer protection extends to issues like ensuring exchanges do not misuse customer funds, requiring clear risk warnings on volatile crypto assets, and establishing rules about who is liable when things go wrong. The challenge is balancing protection with allowing innovation.",
    "example": "The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) requires that investment products disclose risks in plain language. If a DeFi platform advertises '20% guaranteed returns' without disclosing the risks of smart-contract failure or token collapse, regulators may intervene to protect consumers from misleading claims."

  {
    "id": "deadweight-loss",
    "detailed": "Deadweight loss is the economic value that is permanently destroyed -- not transferred to anyone -- when a market is prevented from reaching its natural equilibrium. Imagine regulation forces a tax or restriction that raises the cost of a product. Some buyers who would have purchased at the lower price now choose not to buy, and some sellers who would have sold at the lower price cannot profitably do so. The transactions that would have benefited both sides simply never happen. Economists visualize this as a triangle on a supply-and-demand graph (called a Harberger triangle). The key insight is that this value does not go to the government or anyone else -- it vanishes entirely.",
    "example": "If a country bans crypto exchanges, people who would have traded legally now either stop trading (losing potential gains) or move to unregulated offshore platforms. The economic value of those lost legitimate trades is the deadweight loss of the ban."
  },
  {
    "id": "economies-of-scale",
    "detailed": "Economies of scale occur when a company's average cost per unit drops as it produces or serves more. This happens because certain expenses -- such as office rent, software licenses, or management salaries -- stay roughly the same whether you serve 1,000 customers or 1,000,000. Spreading these fixed costs over more units makes each unit cheaper. In financial regulation, economies of scale matter because large firms absorb compliance costs more easily than small ones. A bank with ten million customers might spend USD 100 million on compliance -- just USD 10 per customer -- while a startup with 10,000 customers spending USD 1 million pays USD 100 per customer for the same regulatory burden.",
    "example": "Visa processes over 65,000 transactions per second. Its cost per transaction is fractions of a cent because the massive network infrastructure cost is spread over billions of transactions. A small payment startup processing just thousands of transactions pays far more per transaction for similar security and compliance systems."
  },
  {
    "id": "externality",
    "detailed": "An externality is a cost or benefit that affects someone who was not part of the original transaction. A negative externality imposes costs on bystanders -- like a factory polluting a river that others rely on for drinking water. A positive externality provides benefits to outsiders -- like a person getting vaccinated, which also protects unvaccinated people nearby. Markets on their own fail to account for externalities because the buyers and sellers do not bear the full consequences of their actions. This is one of the main reasons governments intervene with regulations, taxes, or subsidies to push markets toward outcomes that are better for society as a whole.",
    "example": "When a cryptocurrency exchange suffers a massive hack, the price drop hurts all holders of that cryptocurrency, not just the exchange's customers. The exchange's poor security imposed a negative externality on the broader market. Regulators respond by requiring minimum security standards for all exchanges."

  {
    "id": "extraterritorial-jurisdiction",
    "detailed": "Extraterritorial jurisdiction is when a country applies its own laws to companies or individuals located in other countries, typically because those foreign entities serve the first country's citizens or use its financial infrastructure. This is common in finance because money flows across borders easily, especially in digital finance where a crypto exchange based in Country A can serve users in Country B with just an internet connection. Regulators argue that if foreign firms want access to their domestic customers, those firms must play by domestic rules. This creates complex overlapping obligations for global companies, who may face contradictory requirements from multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.",
    "example": "The U.S. SEC has sued foreign crypto exchanges for offering unregistered securities to American users, even though the exchanges were headquartered outside the United States. Similarly, the EU's MiCA regulation applies to any crypto firm serving EU customers, regardless of where that firm is based."

  {
    "id": "fatf",
    "detailed": "The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization that sets global standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing (collectively called AML/CFT -- Anti-Money Laundering / Combating the Financing of Terrorism). Founded in 1989, it does not directly enforce laws but publishes recommendations that its 39 member countries are expected to adopt. FATF periodically reviews each country's compliance and can place non-compliant nations on a \"grey list\" (increased monitoring) or \"black list\" (high-risk), which makes it harder and more expensive for those countries to participate in global finance. Its recommendations heavily shape crypto regulation worldwide.",
    "example": "When FATF issued its 'Travel Rule' guidance requiring crypto exchanges to share sender and receiver information for transactions above USD 1,000, exchanges worldwide had to build new compliance systems. Countries like Pakistan that appear on the FATF grey list face higher transaction costs and reduced access to international banking."

  {
    "id": "fsb",
    "detailed": "The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors the global financial system and makes recommendations to promote financial stability. Created in 2009 after the global financial crisis, it coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies. The FSB focuses on identifying systemic risks (threats that could bring down the entire financial system, not just one firm) and developing policies to address them. In digital finance, the FSB has published frameworks for regulating stablecoins and crypto-asset activities, particularly those large enough to pose risks to the broader financial system.",
    "example": "In 2023, the FSB published a global framework for regulating crypto-asset activities, recommending that stablecoins like Tether be subject to the same reserve and redemption requirements as traditional money market funds. Member countries then use these recommendations to shape their domestic laws."
  },
  {
    "id": "functional-regulation",
    "detailed": "Functional regulation means regulating financial activities based on what they do -- such as lending, taking deposits, or trading securities -- rather than what type of company performs them. Under this approach, a traditional bank offering crypto trading services and a crypto-native exchange offering the same service would both follow the same set of rules because the activity is identical. This contrasts with institutional regulation (regulating by entity type), where a bank and a tech company doing the same thing might face completely different rules. Functional regulation is increasingly favored in digital finance because the same activities often occur across very different types of institutions.",
    "example": "If a DeFi lending protocol lets users deposit funds and earn interest, functional regulation would require it to follow the same deposit-protection rules as a traditional bank, because the activity -- taking deposits and lending them out -- is functionally identical, regardless of whether it runs on a blockchain or in a bank branch."
  },
  {
    "id": "grey-listing",
    "detailed": "Grey-listing is a designation by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force, the global anti-money-laundering standard-setter) that a country has strategic deficiencies in its framework for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. Being grey-listed does not mean a country is blacklisted or sanctioned, but it signals to banks and businesses worldwide that extra caution is needed when dealing with that country. In practice, grey-listed nations face higher transaction fees, longer processing times for international transfers, reduced foreign investment, and difficulty accessing correspondent banking services (arrangements where international banks process payments on behalf of local banks).",
    "example": "When South Africa was placed on the FATF grey list in 2023, its banks faced increased scrutiny from international partners, cross-border transactions slowed, and several foreign investors paused new commitments until the country addressed the identified deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering systems."
  },
  {
    "id": "information-asymmetry",
    "detailed": "Information asymmetry exists when one party in a transaction has more or better information than the other party. This imbalance can lead to two major problems: adverse selection (before a deal, the less-informed party attracts bad counterparts -- like an insurer who cannot distinguish healthy from sick applicants) and moral hazard (after a deal, the better-informed party takes hidden risks -- like a driver who drives recklessly after buying insurance). In digital finance, information asymmetry appears when project insiders know their token is worthless while investors do not, or when a borrower on a DeFi platform knows they will default but the lender cannot see this.",
    "example": "A crypto project team knows their code has a critical bug but continues selling tokens to the public. Buyers, lacking access to this insider knowledge, purchase tokens at full price. This information asymmetry harms buyers and is exactly the type of problem that disclosure regulations aim to prevent."
  },
  {
    "id": "institutional-regulation",
    "detailed": "Institutional regulation means assigning regulatory responsibility based on what type of entity a company is -- for example, banks are overseen by banking regulators, insurance companies by insurance regulators, and securities firms by securities regulators. Each entity type has its own dedicated supervisor with clear jurisdictional boundaries. This approach works well when financial activities map neatly to specific institution types, but it struggles with digital finance, where a single crypto platform might simultaneously act as a bank (holding deposits), an exchange (facilitating trades), and an investment advisor (recommending assets). Gaps and overlaps emerge when one entity performs activities spanning multiple regulatory categories.",
    "example": "In the United States, banks are regulated by the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency), while securities firms answer to the SEC. A crypto exchange like Coinbase that offers both trading and custody services may need to satisfy multiple institutional regulators, each with different and sometimes conflicting requirements."
  },
  {
    "id": "kyc",
    "detailed": "Know Your Customer (KYC) is the process financial institutions use to verify the identity of their clients before and during the business relationship. At its simplest, KYC means checking a government-issued ID and proof of address when someone opens an account. More advanced KYC involves ongoing monitoring of transactions, checking customers against sanctions lists (government lists of people or organizations that are banned from financial services), and assessing the risk level of each customer based on their profile and behavior. KYC is a cornerstone of anti-money-laundering (AML) compliance and applies to banks, exchanges, and increasingly to crypto platforms that handle fiat currency or large transaction volumes.",
    "example": "When you sign up for a crypto exchange like Binance, you must upload a photo of your passport, take a selfie for facial matching, and sometimes provide proof of your home address. This KYC process is why anonymous accounts are being phased out on major regulated exchanges worldwide."
  },
  {
    "id": "market-failure",
    "detailed": "A market failure occurs when a free market, left on its own without government intervention, fails to allocate resources in a way that maximizes total benefit to society. Common causes include externalities (costs or benefits spilling over onto uninvolved parties), information asymmetry (one side knowing more than the other), public goods (things everyone benefits from but nobody wants to pay for, like national defense), and market power (monopolies charging excessive prices). Market failures provide the economic justification for regulation: if the market were working perfectly, there would be less need for rules. The goal of regulation is to correct these failures and move outcomes closer to what economists call efficiency.",
    "example": "Without regulation, a dominant crypto exchange could manipulate prices, hide fee structures, and refuse to honor withdrawals -- all because individual customers lack the power or information to protect themselves. The FCA (UK Financial Conduct Authority) steps in precisely because the market alone fails to prevent such abuses."
  },
  {
    "id": "moral-hazard",
    "detailed": "Moral hazard occurs when a person or institution takes on more risk than they normally would because someone else will bear the consequences if things go wrong. The classic example is insurance: once you have fire insurance, you might be less careful about fire safety because the insurance company pays for damage, not you. In finance, moral hazard arises when banks take excessive risks knowing the government will bail them out to prevent a financial crisis -- the profits go to the bank, but losses are absorbed by taxpayers. In digital finance, moral hazard can appear when a DeFi protocol promises to compensate users for losses, encouraging riskier behavior than the system was designed for.",
    "example": "During the 2008 financial crisis, large banks had taken enormous risks in mortgage lending. When they collapsed, governments bailed them out because they were 'too big to fail.' Knowing bailouts were likely had encouraged the risk-taking in the first place -- a textbook moral hazard cycle."
  },
  {
    "id": "nash-equilibrium",
    "detailed": "A Nash equilibrium is a concept from game theory (the mathematical study of strategic decision-making) describing a situation where no participant can improve their outcome by changing their own strategy alone, assuming everyone else keeps doing what they are doing. It does not mean everyone is happy or that the outcome is optimal for society -- it just means nobody has a reason to unilaterally switch. In regulatory economics, Nash equilibrium helps explain why countries may maintain low regulatory standards even when global cooperation would be better: each country individually benefits from attracting business with lax rules, so no single country wants to tighten up first.",
    "example": "Two countries both know stricter crypto regulation would reduce fraud globally. But if only one tightens rules, exchanges simply move to the other country. Neither country acts alone, so both maintain weak regulation -- a Nash equilibrium that is bad for everyone but stable because neither side wants to move first."
  },
  {
    "id": "principles-based-regulation",
    "detailed": "Principles-based regulation sets broad, high-level goals -- such as 'treat customers fairly' or 'maintain adequate capital' -- and gives regulated firms flexibility in how they achieve those goals. Regulators then use supervisory judgment to assess whether a firm's approach meets the spirit of the principle. The advantage is adaptability: principles can cover new technologies and business models without needing constant rule updates. The disadvantage is uncertainty: firms may struggle to know exactly what compliance looks like, and enforcement can seem subjective or inconsistent. This approach is often contrasted with rules-based regulation, which specifies exact requirements but can be rigid and easy to game.",
    "example": "The UK's FCA operates largely on principles-based regulation. Rather than specifying exactly how a crypto firm must protect customer funds, the FCA requires firms to 'safeguard client assets' and judges each firm's method individually. This gives innovative firms room to find creative compliance solutions."
  },
  {
    "id": "prisoners-dilemma",
    "detailed": "The Prisoner's Dilemma is a foundational game-theory scenario where two individuals, acting in pure self-interest, each choose a strategy that leads to an outcome worse for both than if they had cooperated. The name comes from a thought experiment: two suspects are interrogated separately and each can either stay silent (cooperate with each other) or betray the other (defect). Betrayal gives a better personal result regardless of what the other does, so both betray -- but mutual betrayal leads to harsher punishment than mutual silence. In regulation, this explains why competing countries often engage in a 'race to the bottom' on regulatory standards, each hoping to attract business at the expense of global stability.",
    "example": "Singapore and Switzerland both want to attract crypto companies. Each country could enforce strict consumer-protection rules, but fears that the other will offer lighter rules and steal the business. Both end up with weaker regulation than either truly prefers -- a Prisoner's Dilemma in regulatory competition."
  },
  {
    "id": "proportionality",
    "detailed": "Proportionality is the regulatory principle that the intensity and cost of oversight should match the level of risk an entity poses and its size or complexity. A small fintech startup handling modest transaction volumes should not face the same compliance burden as a global bank moving trillions of dollars. Without proportionality, heavy-handed regulation would crush small innovators while barely affecting large incumbents, reducing competition and innovation. In practice, proportionality means tiered licensing (different license types for different risk levels), simplified reporting for small firms, and phased compliance timelines that give startups time to build up their compliance capacity gradually.",
    "example": "The EU's MiCA regulation uses proportionality by requiring stablecoin issuers with more than EUR 200 million in circulation to meet stricter reserve and audit requirements, while smaller issuers face lighter obligations. This prevents small projects from being buried under compliance costs designed for giants like Tether."
  },
  {
    "id": "prudential-regulation",
    "detailed": "Prudential regulation consists of rules designed to ensure that financial institutions remain safe, solvent (able to pay their debts), and sound over time. These rules typically require institutions to hold minimum amounts of capital (a financial buffer to absorb losses), maintain adequate liquidity (enough cash or easily sellable assets to meet withdrawal demands), manage risks properly, and submit to regular examinations by supervisors. The goal is to prevent individual firm failures that could harm depositors or trigger wider financial instability. In digital finance, the question is whether crypto platforms holding customer funds should face similar prudential requirements as banks.",
    "example": "After the collapse of FTX in 2022, regulators argued that if the exchange had been subject to prudential rules -- like maintaining capital reserves equal to a percentage of customer deposits -- it could not have secretly lent out billions of dollars of customer funds. Basel III capital requirements for banks exist to prevent exactly this kind of failure."
  },
  {
    "id": "regtech",
    "detailed": "RegTech (Regulatory Technology) refers to software tools and platforms that help financial companies comply with regulations more efficiently and at lower cost. Instead of relying on armies of compliance staff manually reviewing transactions, RegTech solutions use automation, artificial intelligence, and data analytics to handle tasks like identity verification (KYC, or Know Your Customer), transaction monitoring for suspicious activity (AML, or Anti-Money Laundering), regulatory reporting, and risk assessment. RegTech benefits both firms (reducing compliance costs) and regulators (receiving cleaner, more timely data). It is the compliance side's counterpart to SupTech, which gives regulators similar technological tools.",
    "example": "A RegTech company like Chainalysis provides tools that automatically trace cryptocurrency transactions across blockchains, flagging wallets associated with sanctioned individuals or known criminal activity. An exchange using this software can screen thousands of transactions per second instead of reviewing them manually."
  },
  {
    "id": "regulatory-arbitrage",
    "detailed": "Regulatory arbitrage is the practice of deliberately structuring business activities to take advantage of differences in rules across jurisdictions (different countries or regions) or across regulatory categories (different asset classifications). Companies may relocate operations to countries with lighter regulation, restructure products to fall outside certain regulatory definitions, or split activities across entities to avoid triggering specific thresholds. While not always illegal, regulatory arbitrage undermines the intent of regulation by allowing firms to enjoy the benefits of operating in well-regulated markets while avoiding the associated costs and protections. It is a major challenge in digital finance because blockchain-based services can operate globally from anywhere.",
    "example": "A crypto lending platform incorporates in the Cayman Islands to avoid U.S. securities laws but continues serving American customers through a website. By exploiting the gap between where it is registered and where its customers are, the platform engages in regulatory arbitrage to minimize its compliance obligations."
  },
  {
    "id": "regulatory-capture",
    "detailed": "Regulatory capture occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political interests of the industry it is supposed to oversee. This happens gradually: industry insiders become regulators, regulated firms provide the technical expertise that agencies rely on, and constant lobbying shapes rules to favor incumbents over newcomers. The result is regulation that protects established firms from competition rather than protecting consumers. In digital finance, capture risk exists when traditional financial institutions lobby for strict crypto regulations that they can afford to comply with but that would eliminate smaller competitors.",
    "example": "If major banks successfully lobby for crypto regulations requiring a banking license to offer any token custody service, small crypto startups would be shut out of the market. The regulation would protect banks from competition rather than protecting consumers -- a sign of regulatory capture."
  },
  {
    "id": "regulatory-perimeter",
    "detailed": "The regulatory perimeter is the boundary that defines which activities, entities, and products fall under a regulator's oversight and which ones remain outside it. Activities inside the perimeter must follow the rules, obtain licenses, and submit to examinations. Activities outside the perimeter operate in an unregulated space. A key challenge in digital finance is that many crypto activities -- like decentralized lending or peer-to-peer token swaps -- were designed to operate outside traditional regulatory perimeters. Regulators worldwide are actively debating whether and how to expand their perimeters to capture these new activities, balancing the need for protection against the risk of stifling innovation.",
    "example": "In the UK, peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions between individuals fall outside the FCA's regulatory perimeter, meaning no consumer protections apply. But if a company operates an exchange facilitating those same transactions, it steps inside the perimeter and must register, follow AML rules, and protect customer funds."
  },
  {
    "id": "rules-based-regulation",
    "detailed": "Rules-based regulation specifies precise, detailed requirements that regulated firms must follow -- exact capital ratios, specific reporting formats, mandatory disclosure checklists, and defined operational procedures. The advantage is clarity: firms know exactly what they must do, and enforcement is straightforward because compliance is binary (you either meet the number or you do not). The disadvantage is rigidity: detailed rules cannot anticipate every new product or business model, so firms can technically comply with the letter of the law while violating its spirit. Rules-based systems also require frequent updates as markets evolve, creating regulatory lag where innovation outpaces the rules.",
    "example": "The U.S. approach to securities regulation is largely rules-based: the SEC's Regulation D specifies exact conditions under which a company can sell securities without full public registration, including precise investor income thresholds (USD 200,000 annual income) and maximum fundraising amounts."
  },
  {
    "id": "same-risk-same-regulation",
    "detailed": "Same risk, same regulation is the principle that any financial activity posing the same type and level of risk to consumers or the financial system should be subject to the same regulatory requirements, regardless of what kind of entity performs it or what technology is used. If a DeFi lending protocol creates the same risks as a traditional bank -- such as the risk of losing depositors' money -- it should face equivalent capital, disclosure, and consumer-protection rules. This principle aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage (exploiting rule differences to avoid compliance) and ensure a level playing field. It is central to how policymakers are approaching crypto regulation globally.",
    "example": "The ECB (European Central Bank) argues that if a stablecoin like USDC functions as a payment instrument just like a bank deposit, then USDC's issuer should face the same reserve, redemption, and audit requirements as a bank. The activity is the same, so the regulation should be too."
  },
  {
    "id": "sandbox",
    "detailed": "A regulatory sandbox is a controlled environment set up by a regulator where companies can test new financial products, services, or business models with real customers under relaxed regulatory requirements for a limited time. Think of it as a safe playground: the company gets to experiment and learn, while the regulator observes closely and gathers data about risks and benefits before deciding on permanent rules. Sandboxes typically have conditions such as limited customer numbers, maximum transaction amounts, enhanced consumer disclosures, and mandatory progress reports. If the test succeeds, the company can apply for a full license under adapted rules. Sandboxes help regulators keep pace with innovation without either blocking it or letting it run unchecked.",
    "example": "The UK's FCA launched one of the first regulatory sandboxes in 2016. A blockchain-based remittance startup could serve up to 1,000 real customers for six months under relaxed licensing rules, while the FCA monitored results. If the pilot went well, the startup could then apply for full authorization."
  },
  {
    "id": "self-custody",
    "detailed": "Self-custody means holding your own private keys (the secret codes controlling access to your cryptocurrency) directly, without relying on a third party like an exchange or bank. It is the digital equivalent of keeping cash in your own safe rather than a bank vault. The advantage is full control: no intermediary can freeze your funds, go bankrupt with your assets, or deny access. The disadvantage is full responsibility: if you lose your private keys or they are stolen, there is no way to recover your funds. Self-custody raises major regulatory questions because KYC (identity verification) and AML (anti-money-laundering) rules are hard to apply without an intermediary.",
    "example": "Using a hardware wallet like Ledger, you store your Bitcoin private keys on a physical device you keep at home. If the device is lost or damaged and you did not back up your recovery phrase (a set of words that regenerates your keys), your Bitcoin is permanently inaccessible -- no bank or regulator can help."

  {
    "id": "suptech",
    "detailed": "SupTech (Supervisory Technology) refers to technological tools that regulators and supervisors use to monitor financial markets, detect risks, and enforce rules more effectively. While RegTech helps companies comply with regulations, SupTech helps the regulators themselves do their jobs better. SupTech tools can automatically scan millions of transactions for suspicious patterns, use machine learning to detect market manipulation, analyze social media for early warning signals of bank runs, and process regulatory filings in real time instead of waiting for periodic reports. This allows regulators to be proactive rather than reactive, catching problems before they become crises rather than investigating after the damage is done.",
    "example": "The Monetary Authority of Singapore uses SupTech tools that automatically analyze blockchain transaction data in real time, flagging unusual patterns that might indicate money laundering. Instead of waiting for quarterly reports from exchanges, regulators can spot suspicious activity as it happens."
  },
  {
    "id": "systemic-risk",
    "detailed": "Systemic risk is the danger that the failure of one financial institution, market, or instrument triggers a chain reaction of failures throughout the entire financial system, much like one falling domino toppling all the others. This differs from the risk of a single company going bankrupt: systemic risk threatens the stability of the whole economy. It typically arises from interconnectedness (institutions owing money to each other), concentration (too much activity in too few hands), and contagion (panic spreading from one market to another). Regulators focus heavily on systemic risk because individual firms may rationally take risks that, when combined across the system, become catastrophic for everyone.",
    "example": "When Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, it owed money to hundreds of other financial institutions worldwide. Those institutions then faced losses, causing them to pull back lending, which hurt businesses, which triggered layoffs -- a cascading chain reaction. Regulators now designate certain firms as 'systemically important' and subject them to stricter oversight to prevent a repeat."
  },
  {
    "id": "technology-neutral-regulation",
    "detailed": "Technology-neutral regulation means writing rules that focus on what an activity does and what risks it creates, rather than specifying or restricting the particular technology used to perform it. Under this approach, the same rules apply whether a payment is processed through a traditional banking network, a mobile app, or a blockchain. The advantage is future-proofing: regulations do not need to be rewritten every time a new technology emerges. The disadvantage is that truly technology-neutral rules can sometimes miss technology-specific risks, such as smart-contract vulnerabilities unique to blockchain systems. Most modern regulatory frameworks aspire to technology neutrality but sometimes add technology-specific provisions where unique risks exist.",
    "example": "The EU's MiCA regulation aims to be technology-neutral: whether a stablecoin's reserves are managed through traditional bank accounts or through blockchain-based smart contracts, the issuer must meet the same reserve adequacy and transparency requirements. The rules care about the outcome, not the plumbing."

  {
    "id": "travel-rule",
    "detailed": "The Travel Rule is a regulation, recommended globally by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force), requiring financial institutions to transmit identifying information about the sender (originator) and receiver (beneficiary) when transferring funds above a certain threshold. The name comes from the idea that the identifying information must 'travel' alongside the money. Originally created for traditional bank wire transfers, the Travel Rule has been extended to cryptocurrency transactions, requiring exchanges to share customer names, account numbers, and addresses with each other for transfers above the threshold (typically USD/EUR 1,000). This makes it harder for criminals to move money anonymously through the financial system.",
    "example": "If you send 2,000 USDT from your Kraken account to someone's Binance account, Kraken must transmit your name, account details, and address to Binance along with the transfer. Binance must verify this information before crediting the funds, just as traditional banks do for wire transfers above the threshold."
